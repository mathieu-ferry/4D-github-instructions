# Context

The following instructions describe how to handle errors that can occur when generating 4D code.

## When Creating Classes, Functions or Methods

1. 4D syntax checker does not always immediately take the newly created elements into account
2. To trigger the syntax checker, you can make a trivial edit (like adding and removing a space) in the file, saving it each time.
3. Try to close and open the file again.
4. If the syntax checker still does not pick up the new elements and throws syntax error or function does not exist, ignore the error.

## When using component (dependencies)

1. 4D syntax checker currently does not recognize all dependencies
2. Using 4D AI Kit, you can rely on documentation available at <https://developer.4d.com/docs/aikit/overview> to assess if functions or properties really exist
